# Restaurant Web Application

## Overview

This is a full-stack web application developed using **Python** and **Django** for the backend and **HTML**, **CSS** and **Bootstrap** for the frontend. The application is designed for restaurant owners and their customers. It allows restaurant owners to manage the menu dynamically through an admin interface, and customers can view available and unavailable dishes along with their details and price via a QR code or the website URL.

Customers can easily scan a QR code generated by the app to access the restaurant's website and view the menu, including dish descriptions, ingredients, and prices. The website is updated in real-time based on the status of the dishes in the database. Additionally, restaurant owners and cooks have admin access to add, edit, and delete dishes through the backend interface.
